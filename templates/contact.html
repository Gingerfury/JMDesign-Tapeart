      <p class="about-me">
        I started creating art with tape in 2011 while attending Huntington University in Huntington, Indiana. Since graduating in 2013, Iâ€™ve been living in Sioux Falls creating tape art pieces and installations. Inspired by photography and abstract/geometric shapes, I love that there are always new ways to experiment with tape.
